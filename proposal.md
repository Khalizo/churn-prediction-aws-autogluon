The project is a Kaggle competition, [Customer Churn Prediction 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/customer-churn-prediction-2020/overview)

## Domain Background

This competition is about predicting whether a customer will change telecommunications provider, something known as `churning`.

## Problem Statement

Customer churn is a common problem for businesses that provide subscription services. It is often difficult to determine when exactly a customer is likely to churn, due to the fact
that it could be caused by several reasons.

The challenge is to predict whether a customer will churn or not using 19 input features defined in the dataset. The accuracy of the model will be the main metric for determining its success.

## Datasets and Inputs

The training dataset contains 4250 samples. Each sample contains 19 features and 1 boolean variable `churn` which indicates the class of the sample. The 19 input features and 1 target variable are:

### File Descriptions

All of these files can be found in `dataset` folder within the submission:

- **train.csv** - the training set.
  Contains 4250 lines with 20 columns. 3652 samples (85.93%) belong to class churn=no and 598 samples (14.07%) belong to class churn=_yes_

- **test.csv** - the test set.
  Contains 750 lines with 20 columns: the index of each sample and the 19 features (missing the target variable `churn`).

- **sampleSubmission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

### Data Fields

1. `state`, _string_. 2-letter code of the US state of customer residence
2. `account_length`, _numerical_. Number of months the customer has been with the current telco provider
3. `area_code`, _string_=`area_code_AAA` where AAA = 3 digit area code.
4. `international_plan`, _string_,(yes/no). The customer has international plan.
5. `voice_mail_plan`, _string_, (yes/no). The customer has voice mail plan.
6. `number_vmail_messages`, _numerical_. Number of voice-mail messages.
7. `total_day_minutes`, _numerical_. Total minutes of day calls.
8. `total_day_calls`, _numerical_. Total minutes of day calls.
9. `total_day_charge`, _numerical_. Total charge of day calls.
10. `total_eve_minutes`, _numerical_. Total minutes of evening calls.
11. `total_eve_calls`, _numerical_. Total number of evening calls.
12. `total_eve_charge`, _numerical_â€¢. Total charge of evening calls.
13. `total_night_minutes`, _numerical_. Total minutes of night calls.
14. `total_night_calls`, _numerical_. Total number of night calls.
15. `total_night_charge`, _numerical_. Total charge of night calls.
16. `total_intl_minutes`, _numerical_. Total minutes of international calls.
17. `total_intl_calls`, _numerical_. Total number of international calls.
18. `total_intl_charge`, _numerical_. Total charge of international calls
19. `number_customer_service_calls`, _numerical_. Number of calls to customer service
20. `churn`, _categorical_, (yes/no). Customer churn - target variable.

## Solution Statement

The problem is a classification problem which will require using machine learning algorithms to predict the classes.

In this project, I propose using AutoGluon for this supervised learning task on tabular data. With AutoGluon I plan on automating the data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection and hyperparameter tuning to find the top-performing model that would be ready for production.

## Benchmark Model

The benchmark model that I will compare my solution to would be the `BaggingClassifier` produced by [another kaggler](https://www.kaggle.com/code/srushanthbaride2010/customer-churn-prediction-score-0-96000) that achieved an accuracy of 96% accuracy on this dataset.

## Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation metric for this competition is the test accuracy, defined as follows:

## Project Design

The workflow for approaching a solution:

1. `Data Analysis`: understand the datasets
2. `Features Transformation`: convert variables into features. Standardize/normalize features, apply numerical transformations
3. `Features Selection`: select relevant features
4. `Machine Learning Models`: train different models using AutoGluon. Perform hyperparameter
5. `Evaluation`: evaluate the performance of each strategy, and check possibilities of combining them to extract the best of each one and achieving an optimal model.
6. `Deployment`: deploy the trained model to an AWS endpoint
7. `Lambda & Step Functions`: set up a AWS Lambda & Step Function for calling the deployed model.
8. `Web App`: Create a web app by deploying the model on streamlit or flask.
